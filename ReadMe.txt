Thank you for Installing Eggplant DOSBox.
This is a beta version and I'll probebly leave it that way.
This version should work with single or multiple asm and c files.
****This is not a compiler or debuger so it wont tell you if have logic or syntax error.
All it does is just launch everything for you.

BUT!
* I assumed that you Installed DOSBox and Notepad++ without changing %AppData% option.
* I also asuumed that you have tasm, tcc and tlink at c:\tc\bin

User Instractions:
- Open Eggplant DOSBox or Press Alt+F5 on Notepad++
- Choose file\s to run

BONUS:
Type newasm on notepad++ and then Ctrl+Alt+N.
It will create a simple asm file.
