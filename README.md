# Eggplant-DOSBox
An automation tool for running and debugging .asm files with DOSBox.

This is a beta version and I'll probebly leave it that way.
I created this project in my 2th semester so the coding level is is probably low.

* This version should work with single or multiple asm and c files.
* This is not a compiler or debuger so it wont tell you if have logic or syntax error.
All it does is just launch everything for you.

## User Instractions:
- Make sure you installed DOSBox 0.74/0.74-2 and Notepad++ on your computer.
- Make sure you have tasm, tcc and tlink at c:\tc\bin
- Download this project and install EggplantDOSBox setup-v0.85.exe.
your antivirus may say someting about viruses, this is why you can check the sourse code and compile it yourself using ahk compile tool.
- Open Eggplant DOSBox
- Choose file\s to run
- Run :)

BONUS:
Type newasm on notepad++ and then Ctrl+Alt+N.
It will create a simple asm file.
